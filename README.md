# Library-Console-Application
Computer Science II Final Project

A final for my Computer Science II class, created in May 2019. In this program, we were required to implement multiple classes, inheritence and polymorphism, collections, file i/o, operator overloading, and exception handling. To implement these items, I decided to create a library manager application, which took way, way longer than expected and I almost ran out of time. At the end, I decided to implement accounts, logging in, and password authentication using a basic hash, but if you dig deep enough there's definitely some issues in that code, as I believe it was pushed out in less than an hour. For instance, you can create multiple users with the same username, definitely not my best work there.

The file structure here includes just the .cpp and .h files you need to analyze the code in the corresponding folder. The LibraryConsoleApp folder is my Visual Studio project directory for this final.

Otherwise, there's a lot of interconnected parts and it's a good represenation of what we were supposed to do. It wasn't the most entertaining of projects, but it was definitely a learning experience.
